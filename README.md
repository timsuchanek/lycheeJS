lycheeJS is a Next-Gen Isomorphic Application Engine that
offers a complete solution for prototyping and deployment
of HTML5 or native OpenGL(ES) or libSDL2 based applications.

The development process is optimized for Blink-based browsers
(Chromium, Google Chrome, Opera) and their developer tools.


## Automatic Installation

There are prebuilt packages that ship all dependencies and
runtimes lycheeJS needs in order to work and cross-compile
properly.

Take a look at [lycheejs.org](http://lycheejs.org)
for a list of those available packages.


## Manual Installation


** 1. Download lycheeJS **

Download lycheeJS via [zip-file](https://github.com/LazerUnicorns/lycheeJS/archive/master.zip)
and extract its contents. Rename the lycheeJS-master folder that
was inside the archive accordingly.

```bash
cd ~/Development; # Change to your development folder

wget https://github.com/LazerUnicorns/lycheeJS/archive/master.zip -O lycheeJS-master.zip;
unzip lycheeJS-master.zip;
mv lycheeJS-master lycheeJS;
```

** 2. Download lycheeJS runtimes **

```bash
cd ~/Development; # Change to your development folder

wget https://github.com/LazerUnicorns/lycheeJS-runtime/archive/master.zip;
unzip lycheeJS-runtime-master.zip;
mv lycheeJS-runtime-master ./lycheeJS/bin/runtime;
```


** 3. Start lycheeJS **

If you installed lycheeJS via distributed package, you
can use *lycheeJS Ranger* from the Applications Menu
from your Operating System. This tool offers a GUI for
maintenance and management of lycheeJS and your projects.


If you manually installed lycheeJS, you can start Sorbet via Terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/lycheeJS;
./bin/sorbet.sh start development;
```


## NPM / NodeJS Integration

You can modify the **~/lycheeJS/package.json**/*scripts* section to
use your own sorbet profile. Take a look at the examples *localhost*
or *lycheejs.org*.

```bash
cd ~/Development/lycheeJS;
npm run-script localhost;
```

## Other (unsupported) JavaScript Runtimes

The lycheeJS architecture is independent of the environment which
means it will run on any theoretical JavaScript environment.

The only requirement for such a platform is a fully implemented
[bootstrap API](http://lycheejs.org/documentation/api-bootstrap.html).

For fully supporting a client-side environment, you will also have to implement
a [lychee.Input](http://lycheejs.org/documentation/api-lychee-Input.html),
a [lychee.Renderer](http://lycheejs.org/documentation/api-lychee-Renderer.html),
a [lychee.Storage](http://lycheejs.org/documentation/api-lychee-Storage.html),
and a [lychee.Viewport](http://lycheejs.org/documentation/api-lychee-Viewport.html).

These implementations are fully optional and only necessary if you are using
them inside your Game or Application.
